# keyhunter

![Hunt. Seek. Find](images/keyhunterdog.png)


A lightweight utility for **discovering and collecting keys/tokens** in HTML pages — intended for lab use and authorized security assessments.  

---

## 🔎 Overview

`keyhunter` scans HTML content (from live URLs or saved HTML files) to detect **sensitive patterns** such as API keys, tokens, secrets and other exposed credentials that appear in page markup, scripts or inline data. It helps detect accidental credential exposure on web pages and client-side code.

> ⚠️ **Legal notice:** Use this tool only against targets you own or have explicit permission to test (local projects, staging environments, or contracted engagements). Unauthorized use is illegal.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features (example)

- Fetches a web page (HTTP/HTTPS) and inspects its HTML for predefined patterns (API keys, tokens, strings like `secret`, `key`, `token`, etc.).  

> Note: adjust regexes/patterns to suit your environment and threat model.
